<p class="centered-text">
    I'm Giorgos Chiras, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student from 
    Cyprus with a passion for becoming a skilled programmer. 
    My fascination with computers and video games started 
    young and has led me to pursue programming as a career.
    My passion for programming continues to grow, and I 
    am always excited to learn more and improve my skills.

<h3 class="centered-subtitle"><u>The road ahead for me</u></h3>
<p class="centered-text">
    The road ahead for me is clear. In the short term, I plan to 
    complete my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
    and aim to secure an internship to gain practical 
    experience. After that, I hope to start my career as 
    a software engineer and pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in 
    Software Engineering. I dream of creating a revolutionary 
    application that will make a positive impact on millions
    of people's daily lives.
